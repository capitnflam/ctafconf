============
VIM ctafonf
============


Setup:
======

You'll need a fairly recent version of vim for everything to work.

You'll need to have exuberant-ctags installed to stop having vimrc
complaining at start up.


Windows setup:
==============

Do NOT try to use bin/ct-install (at least not yet)

Copy:

ctafconf/etc/vim/vimrc to $USER\_vimrc
ctafconf/etc/vim        to $USER\vimfiles


Random notes:
============


I'll try to keep the correct file system hierarchy for vim scripts,
so the vimrc itself is  quite small

The various plugins are versionned as they were when I downloaded them,
and some of them are patched, so do not expect to have the latest
version of every plugins.


If you wish to change settings for a particular language, please use
vim/ftplugin/<language>.vim, NOT vimrc.

Non-standard behavior:
 - virtualedit in "block" mode

There is support for profiles, too.
You can put your favorite stuff to
.config/ctafconf/profile/<name>/vimrc
