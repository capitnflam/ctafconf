============
VIM ctafonf
============


Setup:
======

You'll need a fairly recent version of vim for everything to work.

You'll need to have exuberant-ctags installed
to use :TList


Windows setup:
==============

Do NOT try to use bin/ct-install (at least not yet)

Copy:

ctafconf/etc/vim/vimrc to $USER\_vimrc
ctafconf/etc/vim       to $USER\vimfiles


Random notes:
============


I'll try to keep the correct file system hierarchy for vim scripts,
so the vimrc itself is  quite small

I'm using pathogen, so the downloaded plugins are nicely put
in separated directories in etc/vim/bundle.
I update them from time to time ...

If you wish to change settings for a particular language, please use
vim/ftplugin/<language>.vim, NOT vimrc.

There is support for profiles, too.
You can put your favorite stuff to
.config/ctafconf/profile/<name>/vim/<name>/vimrc
This directory too is loaded with pathogen, so you can put your own
plugins here if you want.
For instance, you can add your own snippets to
ctafconf/profile/<name>/vim/mysnippets/ftplugin/after/<language>_mysnippets.vim

Non-standard behavior (abbreviations, new shortcuts, ...) should go in your
profile
